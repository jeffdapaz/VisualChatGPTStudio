# Visual chatGPT Studio

English | [Chinese](README-zh.md)

This is an extension that adds chatGPT functionality directly within Visual Studio.

You will be able to consult the chatGPT directly through the text editor or through a new specific tool window.

[Watch here some examples.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h_wUl_IjWRU)

- For Visual Studio 2022: [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jefferson-pires.VisualChatGPTStudio)
- For Visual Studio 2019: [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jefferson-pires.VisualChatGPTStudio2019)

## Features in text editor

Select a method and right click on text editor and you see these new chatGPT commands:

![image](https://jefferson-pires.gallerycdn.vsassets.io/extensions/jefferson-pires/visualchatgptstudio2019/1.11.0/1691094951157/image__1.png)

- **Complete:** Start write a method, select it and ask for complete.
- **Add Tests:** Create unit tests for the selected method.
- **Find Bugs:** Find bugs for the selected method.
- **Optimize:** Optimize the selected method.
- **Explain:** Write an explanation of the selected method.
- **Add Comments:** Add comments for the selected method.
- **Add Summary:** Add Summary for C# methods.
- **Add Summary For Entire Class:** Add Summary for entire C# class (for methods, properties, enums, interfaces, classes, etc). Don't need to select the code, only run the command to start the process.
- **Ask Anything:** Write a question on the code editor and wait for an answer.
- **Translate:** Replace selected text with the translated version. In Options window edit the command if you want translate to another language instead English.
- **Custom Before:** Create a custom command through the options that inserts the response before the selected code.
- **Custom After:** Create a custom command through the options that inserts the response after the selected code.
- **Custom Replace:** Create a custom command through the options that replace the selected text with the response.

And if you desire that the responses be written on tool window instead on the code editor, press and hold the SHIFT key and select the command (not work with the shortcuts).

If you want chatGPT to respond in another language and/or want to customize the commands for some reason, you can edit the default commands through the options:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63928228/226494626-d422a843-2512-4dee-a177-045f39c0b6d3.png)

For example, by changing the "Explain" prompt of the Explain command to "Explicar en espaÃ±ol" (or just "Explicar"), the OpenAI API will write the comments in Spanish instead of using the default English command.

## Features by "Visual chatGPT Studio" tool window

In this tool window you can ask questions to chatGPT and receive answers directly in it.

The interactions made in this window use the parameters defined in the options of this extension (as well as the commands in the code editor):

You will find this window in menu View -> Other Windows -> Visual chatGPT Studio.

## Features by "Visual chatGPT Studio Turbo" tool window

In this new window editor you can interact directly with chatGPT as if you were in the chatGPT portal itself:

Unlike the previous window, in this one the AI "remembers" the entire conversation, and it can even assume a personality that can be parameterized through the options:

![image](https://jefferson-pires.gallerycdn.vsassets.io/extensions/jefferson-pires/visualchatgptstudio/1.7.1/1679515374543/image__11.png)

![image](https://jefferson-pires.gallerycdn.vsassets.io/extensions/jefferson-pires/visualchatgptstudio/1.7.3/1679698833202/image__14.png)

While the first tool window uses specific language models for Completions, this window uses specific models for Chats, which are GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4, which can be chosen through the options.

Note that GPT-4 it's not currently available for everyone. See [here](https://openai.com/blog/gpt-4-api-general-availability) for more details.

You will find this window in menu View -> Other Windows -> Visual chatGPT Studio Turbo.

## Authentication

To use this tool it is necessary to connect through the OpenAI API or through Azure OpenAI.

### By OpenAI

You need create and set an OpenAI API Key.

You can do this here: [https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys)

### By Azure

See for more details: [https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/openai/overview).

It's also necessary create on azure two resources, one for the Turbo window and another for the menu commands and the other tool window. Please read [this](https://github.com/jeffdapaz/VisualChatGPTStudio/issues/31) for more details.

## Known Issues

Unfortunately, the API that OpenAI makes available for interacting with chatGPT has a limitation on the size of the question plus the given answer.

If the question sent is too long (for example, a method with many lines) and/or the generated response is too long, the API may cut the response or even not respond at all.

For these cases I advise you to make requests via the tool windows to customize the question in a way that chatGPT does not refuse to answer, or try modify the model options to improve the responses.

## Disclaimer

- As this extension depends on the API provided by OpenAI, there may be some change by them that affects the operation of this extension without prior notice.

- As this extension depends on the API provided by OpenAI, there may be generated responses that not be what the expected.

- The speed and availability of responses directly depend on the API provided by OpenAI.

- If you are using OpenAI service instead Azure and receive a message like "429 - You exceeded your current quota, please check your plan and billing details.", check OpenAI Usage page and see if you still have quota, example:

But only change the default values if you know what you're doing, otherwise you might experience some unexpected behavior.

For more details about each property, see the OpenAI documentation: [https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/completions/create).
